// ASSESSMENT 2: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Alpha 2022"
// console.log(cohort.split(""))

// a) Your answer: "A", "l", "p", "h", "a", " ", "2", "0", "2", "2"
// b) Verify and explain: got it right, it took a sting and returned the elements in individual strings


// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeter = (name) => {
  `Hello, ${name}!`
}
// console.log(greeter("LEARN Student"))

// a) Your answer: Hello, LEARN Student!
// b) Verify and explain: the variable is "name" is undefined, i wrote that first but changed my answer 


// --------------------3) What will this log?

var multBy2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].map(value => value * 2)
// console.log(multBy2)

// a) Your answer: [8,10,12,14,16]
// b) Verify and explain: right. it performed the function on the argument 


// --------------------4) What will this log?

var onlyOdds = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].filter(value => value % 2 !== 0)
// console.log(onlyOdds)

// a) Your answer: [0, 2, 4]
// b) Verify and explain: i returned the vales of the elements that fit the perimeter, i thought i was going to return the index?


// --------------------5) What will this log?

var myCodingSkills = {
  languages: ["JavaScript", "Ruby"],
  frameworks: ["React", "Ruby on Rails"],
  databases: "PostgreSQL",
  versionControl: "GitHub"
}
// console.log(myCodingSkills.languages[0])

// a) Your answer: JavaScript
// b) Verify and explain: this one did return the index


// --------------------STRETCH: What will this log?

class Learn {
  constructor(name){
    this.student = name,
    this.cohort = "Alpha",
    this.year = 2022
  }
}
var learnStudent = new Learn("George")
console.log(learnStudent)

// a) Your answer: error, because your are not directing the path to .student or name
// b) Verify and explain: it returned the whole object and plugged in "George" in the variable spot. interesting
