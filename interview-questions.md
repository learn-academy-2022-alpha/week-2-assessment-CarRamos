# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

  Your answer: A parameter is a set of limitations in statement and a argument is value at acts on a statement.

  Researched answer: Parameter and arguments are similar in the fact they both represent values but a parameter is a defined value within a function while a argument is a declared value or a real value passed though a function with the function is called.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters of .map() method is that it will excite and give a value to each element in a array. The optional parameter is a action to each element in addition to the returned value.

Where they differ is the .map method will iterate through an array and return a array with a equal length as the argument while the .filter method will iterate a function through an array as an argument and only return an array that satisfies a stated condition.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?
